# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe, Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a pencil based traditional game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3X3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. If both the players are strong, it may lead to draw.
